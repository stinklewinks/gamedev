# My Game Development Portfolio
This repo houses all of my game development material. All of my game documents, scripts, models, textures, and more live within these directories. I have organized all of the content into respective 
folders and is mainly used for my portfolio and resume. Feel free to download and use any asset with no worry to use in any project that you are working on. 

## More than Games
This portfolio will also include assets for creating virtual productions as well. This is mainly an Unreal repo but I use other game engines like Godot, Unity, and GameMaker Studio.
